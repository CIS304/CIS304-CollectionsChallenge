Develop the code needed for the GUI supplied in the assignment start files. As is, this GUI reads stock data from a CSV file and stores them in an ArrayList.

The code you develop should add the following capabilities to the GUI:

    Load the stock data into the following collections: FIFO queue (i.e., a LinkedList), HashMap, and TreeMap.
    Display on the GUI the contents of the queue, HashMap, and TreeMap.
    Provide the actions implied by the buttons on the GUI - display the contents of the affected collection after each action.
    Prevent the GUI from crashing due to invalid user input.
    Reset the GUI back to its initial state (i.e., the collections contain only the original stock data loaded from the CSV file).

Additional Challenges (for exam preparation):

    Replace the Stock class that came with the start files with the attached version of the Stock class.
    Instead of using separate private methods to display the HashMap and TreeMap contents, write a single private method that can display the contents of any map.
